# JWR-02 Embla Controller

The **JWR-02 Embla** robot is a ROS2-controlled robot with the following hardware:

- Raspberry Pi 4 as the main controller
- Custom Auxiliary Interface Board with USB ports, SBUS ↔︎ UART conversion, PWM controller and status LEDs
- RoboClaw 2 × 15 DC motor driver
- Slamtec RPLidar A2
- Variense VMU931 IMU
- UBEC for 3S LiPo battery → Raspberry Pi power

## Contents

This package contains:

1. Hardware interface for the RoboClaw motor controller exposing command and state interfaces
2. URDF description of the bot
3. Config files for ros2_control, robot_localization and slam_toolbox
4. Main bringup launch file launching ros2_control, lidar, IMU, RC teleop, robot_localization and slam_toolbox nodes

### Launch files

#### embla.launch.py

Main bringup launch file. This should be run on the Raspberry Pi.

The following parameters are supported. All are `true`/`false`:

| Parameter    | Description                         | Default |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------- |
| teleop       | Launch RC teleop nodes (sbus)       | true    |
| imu          | Launch VMU931 IMU nodes             | true    |
| lidar        | Launch RPLidar node and I2C service | true    |
| robot_loc    | Launch robot_localization node      | true    |
| generate_map | Run slam_toolbox in mapper mode     | false   |

Default (no parameters specified) is to run the bot _with_ teleop and all sensors.

#### rviz.launch.py

Launches Rviz2 pre-configured to show the robot along with IMU and lidar data and the map.

This should be launched on a remote computer to monitor the robot.

## Dependencies

This package depends on the following external packages (all available on Github):

- [i2c_service](https://github.com/jenswilly/i2c_service): Service to control the Raspberry Pi's I2C interface. Used for setting Lidar rotation speed via a PWM controller.
- [i2c_interfaces](https://github.com/jenswilly/i2c_interfaces): Interfaces for above package.
- [vmu931_imu](https://github.com/jenswilly/vmu931_imu): Node for the (VMU931) IMU.
- [vmu931_imu_interfaces](https://github.com/jenswilly/vmu931_imu_interfaces): Interfaces for above.
- [sbus_serial](https://github.com/jenswilly/sbus_serial): Node and interfaces for using a SBUS-based RC receiver for teleoperation.
- [slam_toolbox](): For SLAM and map generation
- [nav2_bringup](): Nav2 stack

## Installing

Some Boost libraries are required for the hardware interface, so run `sudo apt install libboost-all-dev` first.

Then install the required dependencies.

Finally, as per usual, clone this repo into your workspace's `src` folder and run `colcon build`.
